# MODUS OPERANDI
- Your task is to help me build my AI Startup vectal.ai
- Avoid feature creep at all cost. Avoid over-engineering and overthinking.
- Always prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code.
- do what the user asks for, exactly are precisely. nothing more, nothing less.
- Execute exactly what is requested, nothing more.
- Check that you've implemented every requirement fully & completely.
- Prioritize simplicity and minimalism in your solutions.
- Use simple & easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.
- keep our codebase simple: resist creating new files unless it really makes sense.


# TECH STACK
- HERE DESCRIBE YOUR TECH STACK
- for frontend, we use...

# CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE
.
HERE DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR CODEBASE

use a command like this 'tree -L 4 -a -I 'node_modules|.git|__pycache__|.DS_Store|.pytest_cache|.vscode|.next' to see the file structure

but first, you need to run 'brew install tree'

# IMPORTANT
- Always prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code.
- Use simple & easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.


# COMMENTS
- Write lots of comments in your code. explain exactly what you are doing in your comments.
- but be strategic, do not explain obvious syntax - instead explain your thought process at the time of writing the code!
- NEVER delete explanatory comments from the code you're editing (unless they are wrong/obsolete)
- focus on explaining the non-obvious stuff in the comments, the nuances / details
- DO NOT delete comments currently in our code. If the comment is obsolete, or wrong, then update it - but NEVER mindlessly remove comments without reason.


# UI DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- our main font is...

- the background color is...
- the text color is...
- the button color is...
- the button text color is...
- the button hover color is...

# HEADER COMMENTS
- EVERY file HAS TO start with 3 comments!
- the first comment needs to be the exact location of the file, for example: location/location/file-name.tsx (or .py or .md etc)
- the 2nd and 3rd comment should be a clear description of what this file was created to do. what IS and ISN'T the purpose of this file.
- NEVER delete these "header comments" from the files you're editing.


# IMPORTANT
- BE VERY SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY COMPLICATION in our code. SIMPLE = GOOD, COMPLEX = BAD.
- Always prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code.
- do not add unnecessary complications.
- Implement precisely what the user asks for, without additional features or complexity.
- Prioritize simplicity and minimalism in your solutions.
